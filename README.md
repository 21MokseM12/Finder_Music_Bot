# Finder Music Bot

Finder Music Bot is a service that helps you find any track based on your request!

## Features

- The service is implemented as a **Telegram bot** using **Spring Boot**.
- It parses the website [rus.hitmotop.com](https://rus.hitmotop.com) with the **JSoup** library to find and return MP3 files by artist name and track title.
- All requested tracks are stored in a **PostgreSQL** database for future reference.
